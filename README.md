## Features

- Angular 6+ (with CLI)
- Angular Material 6+
- Electron (with Builder)
- TypeScript 2.7.2
- SASS
- Hot Reload

## Getting Started

#### Clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/1nv1n/angular-material-electron.git
```

#### Install Dependencies:

There is an issue with `yarn` and `node_modules` that are only used in Electron when the application is built. Please use `npm` as dependency manager.

```bash
npm install
```

If you want to generate Angular components with Angular-CLI , you need `@angular/cli` installed in global context.
Please follow the [Angular-CLI documentation](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) if you had installed a previous version of `angular-cli`.

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

#### Start!

```bash
npm start
```

This should bring up the application running Angular Material with hot reload.
The Electron application code is managed by `main.ts` (`main.js` will be generated during runtime).
The Angular component contains an example of Electron and NodeJS native lib import.

## Troubleshooting

### Error with NodeJS third party packages

Since Angular 6 does not provide an eject anymore, you can't configure your webpack config file to import node externals.
An issue in [Angular repository](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/10681) has been opened about this feature.
Please have a look at this workaround posted on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50234196/after-updating-from-angular-5-to-6-i-keep-getting-the-error-cant-resolve-timer) that may work in some cases.
